H ey guys, I like Dmitry attempt at writing a js wrapper and share it With the world to comment. I was bummed That was disfigured . 

Here it is again, albeit briefly. From the depths of the history of this pad .

Require was onclick Such a walk
With GitHub my skills have nothing to hide
My lack of overall variables is a source of pride
I'm hitting my stride on the client sid e
 
Stop testing IE 6, it's a trap!
Been Crap from way back, everyone knows That
Such rules Dev make a snap
And I do not mean space vs. tab. [Drop microphone ]

You do not waste time coding
AMD will make you feel cool
Which Loose coupling will not look like a fool
 
Just sit right back to hear the story
Brendan will do, we can not stop
It is not three hours, it'll take ten days
Born schema and the car on a lispy mist  .
 
And the amplifier, semicolon, rhymes, I have a lot
I have the coded space, silly is one hundred and twenty
My var locked at closing, Which Is The Drug
There is no fucking or leakin 'since I'm in the right are a.
 
I, JS is / / way,
Where code as a storm
Free spaghetti!
Fierce as the Serengeti
If T His difficult track error
Console has your back
 
You JS code, but the mixing types
And always remember the syntax of "joint"
To write "identical twin" is like throwing says
And you're scared to death ... of prototype s
 
It's time to get up and get a littlez respect
Just go and read the ECMA specifications shit
Unpuzzle, unlock, and decrypt UNCODE
And win yourself the power of true JavaScript
 
You add the number of string and rope array
Divided by subject (you know it's good)
The prototype chain can be seen Through the code ...
It was a great trip from Netscape to Node .
 
And `` bad Eval` with` is whack
Classes F * ck - You Can Have them again
This is the generation of floating mathematics
It's not called the tail In This giant pil and
 
I Var, point math pie in the sky
Fly tries to catch zero size
With new prototypes matrices are lies
disguised as a wise cancellations
prefixed With java, ECMA, mocha, and live
writing all day and all night
Microsize lines of JS
but do auto minify
Above all, I, f * ck static typing
 
Go asynchronous and Then You will never look

and start using four cores on the MacBook Pro.

junkie as close on Your JavaScript
Abuse coma, ASI trick
truth-and compare, you want to write
dfvfd
Bask in the glow, open stopcock /
any script, insignificant white space
`Array arguments`? Is not that difficult
You is not got the call, Captai n Picard
 
M and macros are sweet, my models are not fat
Complete unit test my build script - everything
Drivers are ornaments, models fine view
ECMA - TC-39
 
function code
You do not need any kind, or agile teams
Slingin 'that node, pipes gimme, gimme streams
Give Me That harmony, of our dream s
 
M and code is poor, not all fans
I love my keys and my semicolons
Okay now, you are not you're tight-lipped
it's okay to say you hate CoffeeScript!
 
It was all a dream 
I used to encode the scene vanilla JS 
Backbone and now I have everything in the IDE Zepto
JS is blowing up like I thought it would 
New frames, but the same language in the hood.
And everything is good.
So if you do not know, you know, encoder s. Uh.
